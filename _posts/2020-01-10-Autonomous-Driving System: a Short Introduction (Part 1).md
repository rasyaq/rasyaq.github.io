Autonomous driving, or also known as self-driving, is a hot topic in automotive industry these days. Letting the computer or machine to take over some or all roles of the car driver is very appealing for many people for both industry and consumer.
Not only making our childhood's dream come true to have a real and cool KITT car (remember those beautiful old days?), but also the necessity to increase the driver's as well as passengers' safety and convenience on the road is really high (http://www.vtpi.org/avip.pdf).

Human are prone to error during driving, especially when something happens with their physical condition, e.g., fatigue, sick, and sleepy (which often happens especially during a long ride), etc.
Therefore, if somehow, we manage to build a car that can drive itself, which also improves the road safety and comfort to the driver, it will change the way we live on the road.  For good.

When and how it began is a long story, so if you are interested int the history of autonomous car/driving, you can find the details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_autonomous_cars.
It is worth to be noted that in the early of 21st century, the US government funded some military efforts to develop some demo of unmanned vehicles. After that, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) held a competition for robotic engineers to create an autonomous car. Then the time goes by and before we know it, we ended up in an era where many people and companies including start-ups are competing each other to be the first and the best to create autonomous cars. You might also interested to see this: https://www.2025ad.com/technology/milestones-the-ad-timeline/, which summarizes the autonomous driving milestone.

When someone talks about autonomous driving, or some car's manufacturers (OEM) making a claim to have an autonomous driving car, people working in the field will tend to ask, in what level?
Apparently a society working in Automotive (SAE) and Traffic (NHTSA) have defined the level of autonomy for the driving. Previously, both of them have a different numbers of level, although they meant almost the same thing.
Currently (from September 2016), they have the same numbers of level and similar definition (actually, NHTSA adopt the SAE level), which probably meant to avoid confusion among autonomous driving community.
The level of autonomous driving is divided into 6 stages, which emphasize on the level of human driver's (so alien driver, you are lucky..) intervention/responsibility on the car (and not the capabilities of the car):

##Level 0: 
No automation, human/driver is fully responsible even though there is warning system in the car. This level covers most of the cars in the world when this article is written.
##Level 1: 
Driver assistance,  includes one of the automatic assistance on steering, or acceleration and deceleration. Basically, we call this ADAS. Human drivers are expected to take control on their car.
##Level 2: 
Partial automation,  a more advanced ADAS, includes one or more automatic assistance on steering, acceleration and deceleration. Human drivers are still expected to take control on their car.
##Level 3: 
Conditional automation, the beginning of a so called semi-autonomous driving. The car observes its surrounding and do the the automatic action of all driving functions. Note that human driver is still required to respond when there is a request to intervene the system.
##Level 4: 
High automation, We can call this an autonomous driving, where the car can do all the driving functions, even if the driver fails to respond the request to intervene the system. The responsibility is now higher on the system. At this level, even if you are a driver, you will feel a bit of a passenger or a co-driver of your car.
##Level 5: 
Full automation, This is what we call a complete autonomous driving. So please sit back, relax, enjoy your time and let your car do the rest. No responsibility in your side whatsoever in case something happens, although the car at this level should be the safest of a car can be.

This is the first part of the article. In the next part, I will continue to discuss about the autonomous driving function which covers sensing, planning, mapping, cooperating, and to see a bit where we are now before reaching our ultimate goal, that is, having a level 5 self-driving car.
